#summary Subversion notes
#labels Phase-Implementation

Some dev notes working with subversion, based on the branch section in the subversion book.

= Working with features branches =

Here I describe how I worked on a new feature in a separate branch, to keep trunk stable, and how I merged this work to trunk then. The temporary branch, useless after the merge, was deleted.

== Branch creation ==

 * You can use the `copy` command to copy the trunk to a branch.
 * You can now work there.

== Merge ==

=== Find out the branch the branch revision ===

Within the branch, just type:

{{{
[bsergean@marge1 makepages-scry]$ svn up .
At revision 85.
}}}

Every work should be checked in.

=== Find out when the branch was created, using subversion log ===

If you haven't used a check in comment to mark that, subversion can help you to do that.

}}}

So the branch was created at revision *75*. 

=== dry-run merge, from the trunk ===

{{{
[bsergean@marge1 trunk]$ svn merge --dry-run -r 75:85 https://pytof.googlecode.com/svn/branches/makepages-scry
A    test/WebPageTest.py
A    tools/googlecode-upload.py
U    pytof/photo.py
U    pytof/makepage.py
U    pytof/utils.py
U    pytof/albumdataparser.py
A    share/scry
A    share/scry/PhotoPage.html
A    share/scry.css
U    scripts/pytof.py
U    setup.py
}}}

Check that everything works, then remove the dry run option to do the actual merge.

== Create tag from branch ==

Then you tag, or snapshot the release branch, and you can create a package from that snaphot. Ya shall not work there, it's just used for release engineering. All work should be done in the branch.

{{{
[bsergean@marge1 pytof]$ svn copy branches/0.0.2 tags/0.0.2
A         tags/0.0.2
[bsergean@marge1 pytof]$
[bsergean@marge1 pytof]$
[bsergean@marge1 pytof]$ svn commit -m 'create 0.0.2 tag from 0.0.2 branch'
Adding         tags/0.0.2

Committed revision 88.
}}}

== Properties ==

Usefull when you want to revert a property, like an executable property that you set on a source file. From the subversion [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s02.html book].
