## Introduction

This is where I put my test / exploratory code. It started 8 years ago with a tool to export your pictures out of iPhoto to create old school web gallery, but since then it's mostly sample or test code.

## Pytof

**pytof** (the stuff that exports pictures) was migrated from google code, here are old links.
