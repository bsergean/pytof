pytof testing HOWTO
-------------------


RUNNING TESTS:
To the full test suite, "python test.py" from the test/ directory
Selected parts of the test suite (with -t):
* just one test module: python test.py -t ftp_test
* just one test case:   python test.py -t ftp_test.FTPTest
* just one test:        python test.py -t ftp_test.FTPTest.test_upload_one_file
* several arguments of the -t option can be given as a coma-separated list:
                        python test.py -t ftp_test.FTPTest,exif_test

PROFILING (with -p):
* Saves profiling information in a file. If not specified, defaults to "output/profile.txt".

COVERAGE (with -c):
* Create a test coverage report. If not specified, the files are created in the "output/coverage/" directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it is created automatically.
* Coverage has to be run on the full test suite and without profiling (i.e. it is incompatible with the -t and -p options)
* Code that is not executed with test suite appears highlighted in red in the HTML.

WRITING TESTS:
* There should be one test module per module in the pytof directory. The test module name is based on the original module, with "_test" added.
* When a new test module is created, it should be added to the list at the end of test.py
* Ideally, tests should be silent, i.e. not output anything to the terminal
* [TODO: Finish the list of coding style guide for tests.]
