# Introduction #

To customize your pages, choose a theme name (**foo**), and add and edit some files.

## Style ##

Create a **foo**.css stylesheet file that you will put under the share/pytof/styles directory.

## Page templates ##

Create 3 files with the foo prefix, whose names are:

  * foo\_gallery\_index.ezt
  * foo\_main\_index.ezt
  * foo\_photo\_per\_page.ezt

And store them in the folder share/pytof/templates/

Edit them and replace the html with the one you want for your pages. Words enclosed in brackets will be replaced by their content by pytof.

```
[title] will become:
My super vacations in Acapulco
```

It's quite simple and after some tries you should be able to add your own template. Send it to me and it will be my pleasure to add it to pytof :)
